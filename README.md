# Accesibility
Repository for the first challenge of the bootcamp, focused on accessibility for the page.

I fixed the first section link that wouldn't redirect u to the section. The link was broken due to a missing a ID in the corresponding reference.

I cleaned the code that had redundant selectors. Modified the HTML so the new selectors would still apply

I achieved a similar look to the mock-up

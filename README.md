# Accesibility
## Repository for the first challenge of the bootcamp, focused on accessibility for the page.

Disclaimer:
The base code is not of my making, it comes from the starter code from GitLab

My contribution:

I fixed the first section link that wouldn't redirect u to the corresponding section. The link was broken due to a missing a ID in the corresponding reference.
I cleaned the code that had redundant selectors and modified the HTML so the new selectors would still apply.
I achieved a similar look to the mock-up.
